üêç Python Basics: Conditional and Loop Tasks

This repository contains two beginner-level Python programs:

  **Task 1**: Check if a number is even or odd  
  **Task 2**: Calculate the sum of integers from a given range

---

##  Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

###  Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is **even** or **odd** using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

###  How it works:
The program uses the modulus operator `%` to determine whether the number is divisible by 2.

###  Example Output:
```bash
Enter the integer: 7
7 is an odd number

Enter the integer: 12
12 is an even number

**##  Task 2: Sum of Integers from a to b Using a Loop
**
###  Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two integer inputs from the user (start and end).
2. Uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all integers between them (inclusive).
3. Displays the final sum.

###  Sample Output
```
Enter first integer: 1  
Enter second integer: 50  
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is 1275
```
