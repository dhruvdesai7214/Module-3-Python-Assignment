🐍 Python Basics: Conditional and Loop Tasks

This repository contains two beginner-level Python programs:

  **Task 1**: Check if a number is even or odd  
  **Task 2**: Calculate the sum of integers from a given range

---

##  Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

###  Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is **even** or **odd** using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

###  How it works:
The program uses the modulus operator `%` to determine whether the number is divisible by 2.

###  Example Output:
```bash
Enter the integer: 7
7 is an odd number

Enter the integer: 12
12 is an even number

**Task 2**: Sum of Integers from a to b Using a Loop
 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Takes two integer inputs (start and end of range).

Uses a for loop to iterate from the first number to the second number.

Calculates and displays the total sum.

 How it works:
The program uses a loop and an accumulator variable t to compute the sum.

📌 Example Output:
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter first integer: 1
Enter second integer: 50
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is 1275
